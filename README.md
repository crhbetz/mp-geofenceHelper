# mp-geofenceHelper
A MAD plugin to export MAD geofences in different formats used in the Pogo Mapping Universe

# Attention - 2.0 breaking change (MAD scalability / asyncio)

Version 2.0+ of this plugin has been reworked to operate on the MAD scalability update (currently as of Nov. 2021 on MAD branch `redis_mitm_mapper`), which relies on asyncio. I have no plans for backwards compatability.
